    <p>Before the clouds over Kensington Oval burst into rain, emotions poured onto the ground. When Hardik Pandya, with South Africa needing 10 off two balls, dismissed Kagiso Rabada, Rohit Sharma’s men couldn’t hold their emotions back.

        <br>This was the moment they knew. They wouldn’t care whatever happened after. Their memory would pause at this moment.It was the moment India ended its 13-year wait for a World Cup, this was the hour when they reclaimed the crown of gold they last kissed 17 years ago. And how it was won! In one of the most dramatic T20 finals of all time by a margin of mere seven runs.
        
        Virat Kohli, the batting hero in the most important T20 game of his career, closed his eyes and looked skywards in pure bliss. Rohit Sharma pumped his fists in joy.He might have been emotionally drained but still mustered the bounce and energy to celebrate.<br> Tears rolled down Hardik Pandya’s cheeks; he was the pantomime villain in the build-up to the tournament. Even the picture of restraint, Rahul Dravid, in his last match as head coach, raised his hands.<br> Suryakumar Yadav wrapped his palms over his face, moments after he had plucked one of the greatest catches in World Cup history.</p>
    <p>Window of opportunity </p>
    <p>It was the ray of hope India were looking for. Bumrah stormed in to complete his quota. The target was still within South Africa’s reach — 22 off 18 balls with David Miller still around — but Bumrah seized the moment sending six thunderbolts, each could have bought a wicket on their day. Two runs and Marco Jansen’s wicket, the intrigue intensified. It was a reverse-seaming dervish, slamming the upper pads and crashing onto the stumps.

    <p>It was the ray of hope India were looking for. Bumrah stormed in to complete his quota. The target was still within South Africa’s reach — 22 off 18 balls with David Miller still around — but Bumrah seized the moment sending six thunderbolts, each could have bought a wicket on their day. Two runs and Marco Jansen’s wicket, the intrigue intensified. It was a reverse-seaming dervish, slamming the upper pads and crashing onto the stumps.Great balls keep emerging from Bumrah’s stable — the away-swinger to nail Reeza Hendricks earlier could be the ball of the tournament. To describe Bumrah as the world’s greatest all-format bowler is an understatement. He is one bowler in many, unpeeling his masks to his whims. He is a grandmaster in the blitz with the white ball, he sets up batsmen in the twitch of an eyelid, traps them even before they realise they have been trapped. With the new ball, he operates with the precise mastery of a surgeon, in the middle phase, he is the imposing enforcer, flexing his muscles like an angry bouncer in a pub, and at the death, he is the cold-eyed sniper</p>
    <h3> Rohit Sharma:This my greatest achievementi wanted it badly</h3>

    <p>It was the best of times, it was the worst of times.

        Just because of the desperation with which he coveted a world title, Rohit Sharma placed this T20 World Cup win as the greatest time of his career, the greatest achievement. "This has to be the greatest time, I can say that," Rohit said at the press conference after the match. "It's only because how desperately I wanted to win this. So, all the runs, all the runs that I've scored in all these years, I think it does matter, but I'm not big on stats and all of that. I think winning games for India, winning trophies for India, that is what I look forward to all the time. And having this now right beside me probably has to be, I don't know, honestly, I don't know if it's the greatest or what but it is definitely one of the greatest, I can say that."
        
        Rohit spoke of the desperation again when asked to describe his mental state when he sunk onto the ground and celebrated the win. "I wanted this badly," he said. "It's very hard to put it in words because that moment, I don't want to say what I was thinking and what was going in my mind, but it was a very emotional moment personally for me.</p>
    <p>"I wish I could capture that moment myself but not really, you can't do that but I will always remember that. Yeah, those are the moments you wait for and then you don't plan these things, it just happens because you're so desperate for certain things in life and I was very desperate for this in my life. So happy that we eventually crossed the line this time."</p>
